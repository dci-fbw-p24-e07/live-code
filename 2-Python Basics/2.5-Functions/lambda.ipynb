    "### Lambda function best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use Lambda functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short, simple, logic:** Ideal for concise operations that don't require a full function definition.\n",
    "2. **Higher-order functions:** Works effectively as arguments to higher-order functions like `map()` , `filter()` or `sorted()`\n",
    "3. **Temporary/Throwaway logic:** Useful when a funbction is needed only once and defining it with `def` would cause unnecessary clutter to the code.\n",
    "4. **Improved readability:** Suitable for simple tasks where using a lambda function keeps the code compact and easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to avoid lambda functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complex or multiline logic: Lambdas are limited to a single expression and can quickly become unreadable for more intricate operations.\n",
    "2. Reusable or named functions: If the function needs to be reused or benefits from a descriptive name a standard function would be more appropriate.\n",
    "3. Debugging or documentation: Lambda functions lack the ability to include docstrings and can be harder to debug compared to named functions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tips to follow  best practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use descriptive names** for clarity\n",
    "2. **Keep it simple:** Lambdas should ideally fit on one line and represent straightforward logic\n",
    "3. **Limit nesting:** Avoid using lambda functions within another lambda function or complex data structures unless necessary\n",
    "4. **Prefer readability over conciseness:** if using lambda sacrifices readability. It's better to define a named function."
