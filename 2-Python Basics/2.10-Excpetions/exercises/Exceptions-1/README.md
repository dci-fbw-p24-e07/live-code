# Python basics - Exceptions-II

## IIa: Theoretical Warm Up

Write short answers (2-5 sentences) to the following questions:

1. Name three things that exception processing is good for.
2. What happens to an exception if you donâ€™t do anything special to handle it?
3. How can your script recover (program continuation) from an exception?
4. What is the ```try``` statement for?
5. What are the two common variations of the ```try``` statement?
6. What is the ```raise``` statement for?

## IIb: Practical Warm Up (30 mins)

1. Place ```result="You can't divide by 0"``` in the correct place below such that the program avoids a ```ZeroDivisionError```.

```python
#Type your answer below (pick the correct line).

a=5
b=0
try:
    result=a/b
except ZeroDivisionError:


print(result)
```

2. Place ```msg="You can't add int to string"``` in the correct place below such that the program avoids a ```BaseExceptionError```.

You can use ```except Exception```, although normally you should be careful using such powerful exception statements.

```python
#Type your answer below.

a="Hello World!"
try:
    a + 10



print(msg)

```
3. Place ```msg="You're out of list range"``` in the correct place below such that the program avoids an ```IndexError```.

```python
#Type your answer below.

lst=[5, 10, 20]

try:
    print(lst[5])



print(msg)
```
