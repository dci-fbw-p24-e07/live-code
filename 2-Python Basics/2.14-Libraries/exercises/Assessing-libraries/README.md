# Python Tools and Libraries

## Library assessment

In this exercise, we will focus on assessing libraries (packages).
During analysis try to get to know information, such as:
  * license of library.
  * age of library.
  * is library active maintained.
  * are there any known security issues related to library?
  * does the library seem to fulfill the given purpose?

## Tasks

### 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 1 - assessing libraries 
Your task is to:  
- assess 10 libraries according to given criteria,  
- you can choose them simply using Google or by [filtering](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Scientific%2FEngineering) in PyPI
- present results in the form of table ([HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) table, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) table, [Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-create-tables-in-python-2eaea447d8fd) table - choose your favorite),  
- write and run simple program with given library. 

The `flask` and `requests` packages will be our examples.  Assess packages other than these two.  
The table could be in the following form:  

 <table style="border: 1px;">
  <caption>Assessing packages</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Package</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
    <th>Homepage</th>
    <th>PyPI</th>
    <th>:star: on Github</th>
    <th>Forks on Github</th>
    <th>Version</th>
    <th>Latest release date</th>
    <th>License</th>
    <th>Are the bugs in GH issues?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Flask</td>
    <td>A simple framework for building complex web applications</td>
    <td><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">link</a></td>
    <td><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask/">link</a></td>

    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Requests</td>
    <td>Python HTTP for Humans</td>
    <td><a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">link</a></td>
    <td><a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">link</a></td>
    <td>45766</td>
    <td>8390</td>
    <td>2.26.0</td>
    <td>18 July, 2021</td>
    <td>Apache 2.0</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>---</td>
    <td>---</td>
    <td><a href="---">link</a></td>

  </tr>
</table> 

### **Don't forget to write program with every assessed package** :smiley:
For example: Create a Flask application that displays the current date and time. Your results for `flask` could look as follows in a Browser:  
```bash
The current date and time is: 2023-03-20 13:05:26.165198
```

Your results for `requests` could look as follows:  
```bash
Status code for https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/ is 200
```
