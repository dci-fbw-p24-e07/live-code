    "- Implementing Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a design pattern?\n",
    "- A design pattern is a reusable, general solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It's a template or blueprint, not specific code, that provides a structured approach to solving recurring design challenges. \n",
    "- Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. \n",
    "- Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.\n",
    "- An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.\n",
    "- In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification of patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Creational Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.\n",
    "- These design patterns are all about class instantiation. \n",
    "- This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. \n",
    "- While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Abstract Factory*** - Creates an instance of several families of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. Builder*** - Separates object construction from its representation\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. Factory Method*** - Creates an instance of several derived classes\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. Object Pool*** - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use\n",
    "\n",
    "***5. Prototype*** - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned\n",
    "\n",
    "***6. Singleton*** - A class of which only a single instance can exist\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Structural Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.\n",
    "- These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. \n",
    "- Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. \n",
    "- Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Adapter*** - Match interfaces of different classes\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. Bridge*** - Separates an object’s interface from its \n",
    "\n",
    "***3. Composite*** - A tree structure of simple and composite objects\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. Decorator*** - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "***5. Facade*** - A single class that represents an entire subsystem\n",
    "\n",
    "***6. Flyweight*** - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "***7. Private Class Data*** - Restricts accessor/mutator access\n",
    "\n",
    "***8. Proxy*** - An object representing another object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Behavioural Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.\n",
    "- These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. \n",
    "- Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Chain of responsibility*** - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. Command*** - Encapsulate a command request as an object\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. Interpreter*** - A way to include language elements in a program\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. Iterator*** - Sequentially access the elements of a collection\n",
    "\n",
    "***5. Mediator*** - Defines simplified communication between classes\n",
    "\n",
    "***6. Memento*** - Capture and restore an object's internal state\n",
    "\n",
    "***7. Null Object*** - Designed to act as a default value of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "***8. Observer*** - A way of notifying change to a number of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "***9. State*** - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes\n",
    "\n",
    "***10. Strategy*** - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class\n",
    "\n",
    "***11. Template method*** - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "***12. Visitor*** - Defines a new operation to a class without change"

    "### Implementing Singleton in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intent**\n",
    "- Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.\n",
    "- Encapsulated \"just-in-time initialization\" or \"initialization on first use\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "- Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object. Additionally, lazy initialization and global access are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules of Thumb:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Abstract Factory`, `Builder`, and `Prototype` can use `Singleton` in their implementation.\n",
    "- Facade objects are often Singletons because only one Facade object is required.\n",
    "- State objects are often Singletons.\n",
    "- The advantage of Singleton over global variables is that you are absolutely sure of the number of instances when you use Singleton, and, you can change your mind and manage any number of instances.\n",
    "- The Singleton design pattern is one of the most inappropriately used patterns. Singletons are intended to be used when a class must have exactly one instance, no more, no less. Designers frequently use Singletons in a misguided attempt to replace global variables. A Singleton is, for intents and purposes, a global variable. The Singleton does not do away with the global; it merely renames it.\n",
    "- ***When is Singleton unnecessary?*** Short answer: most of the time. Long answer: when it's simpler to pass an object resource as a reference to the objects that need it, rather than letting objects access the resource globally. The real problem with Singletons is that they give you such a good excuse not to think carefully about the appropriate visibility of an object. Finding the right balance of exposure and protection for an object is critical for maintaining flexibility.\n",
    "- Our group had a bad habit of using global data, so I did a study group on Singleton. The next thing I know Singletons appeared everywhere and none of the problems related to global data went away. The answer to the global data question is not, \"Make it a Singleton.\" The answer is, \"Why in the hell are you using global data?\" Changing the name doesn't change the problem. In fact, it may make it worse because it gives you the opportunity to say, \"Well I'm not doing that, I'm doing this\" – even though this and that are the same thing.\n"

    "### Implementing Factory Method in Python\n",

    "**Intent**\n",
    "- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\n",
    "- Defining a \"virtual\" constructor.\n",
    "- The new operator considered harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "- A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own domain objects and provide for their instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules of thumb:**\n",
    "- Abstract Factory classes are often implemented with Factory Methods, but they can be implemented using Prototype.\n",
    "- Factory Methods are usually called within Template Methods.\n",
    "- Factory Method: creation through inheritance. Prototype: creation through delegation.\n",
    "- Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.\n",
    "- Prototype doesn't require subclassing, but it does require an Initialize operation. Factory Method requires subclassing, but doesn't require Initialize.\n",
    "- The advantage of a Factory Method is that it can return the same instance multiple times, or can return a subclass rather than an object of that exact type.\n",
    "- Some Factory Method advocates recommend that as a matter of language design (or failing that, as a matter of style) absolutely all constructors should be private or protected. It's no one else's business whether a class manufactures a new object or recycles an old one.\n",
    "- The `new` operator considered harmful. There is a difference between requesting an object and creating one. The new operator always creates an object, and fails to encapsulate object creation. A Factory Method enforces that encapsulation, and allows an object to be requested without inextricable coupling to the act of creation."
